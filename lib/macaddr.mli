(** A library for manipulation of MAC address representations.

    {e %%VERSION%% - {{:%%PKG_HOMEPAGE%%} homepage}} *)

exception Parse_error of string * string
(** [Parse_error (err,packet)] is raised when parsing of the MAC address syntax
    fails. [err] contains a human-readable error and [packet] is the original
    octet list that failed to parse. *)

type t
(** Type of the hardware address (MAC) of an ethernet interface. *)

(** {2 Functions converting MAC addresses to/from octets/string} *)

val of_octets_exn : string -> t
(** [of_octets_exn buf] is the hardware address extracted from [buf]. Raises
    [Parse_error] if [buf] has not length 6. *)

val of_octets : string -> (t, [> `Msg of string ]) result
(** Same as {!of_octets_exn} but returns a result type instead of raising an
    exception. *)

val of_string_exn : string -> t
(** [of_string_exn mac_string] is the human-readable hardware address
    represented by [mac_string]. Raises {!Parse_error} if [mac_string] is not a
    valid representation of a MAC address. *)

val of_string : string -> (t, [> `Msg of string ]) result
(** Same as {!of_string_exn} but returns a result type instead of raising an
    exception. *)

val to_octets : t -> string
(** [to_octets mac_addr] is a string of size 6 encoding [mac_addr] as a sequence
    of bytes. *)

val to_string : ?sep:char -> t -> string
(** [to_string ?(sep=':') mac_addr] is the [sep]-separated string representation
    of [mac_addr], i.e. [xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx]. *)

val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
[@@ocaml.toplevel_printer]
(** [pp f mac_addr] outputs a human-readable representation of [mac_addr] to the
    formatter [f]. *)

val broadcast : t
(** [broadcast] is [ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff]. *)

val make_local : (int -> int) -> t
(** [make_local bytegen] creates a unicast, locally administered MAC address
    given a function mapping octet offset to octet value. *)

val get_oui : t -> int
(** [get_oui macaddr] is the integer organization identifier for [macaddr]. *)

val is_local : t -> bool
(** [is_local macaddr] is the predicate on the locally administered bit of
    [macaddr]. *)

val is_unicast : t -> bool
(** [is_unicast macaddr] the is the predicate on the unicast bit of [macaddr]. *)
